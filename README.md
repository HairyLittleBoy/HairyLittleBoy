- 👋 Hi, I’m @HairyLittleBoy,a coder made of 50% of MATLAB, 30% of FORTRAN and 20 of PYTHON
- 👀 I’m interested in using coding to solve engineering problems such as optimization, multi-variant interpolation and fitting, make ABAQUS fall in love with MATLAB, some crystal plastic simulations and extracting material parameters with indentation technique 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying how to make Spherical Indentation Identification more accurate and versatile, also working on how to simulate the deformation of Titanium with code
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my Spherical Indentation Identification project, to make the identification process more efficient, based on multi-variant interpolation and ANN
- 📫 You can reach me through sunzk_cailiao@163.com, and know something about me at https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zk-Sun
- The files under /v3 in SIITGithub repository are some code on how to identify the material parameters with spherical indentation based on optimization, it is quite immature.
